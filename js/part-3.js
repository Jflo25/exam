/**
* snakeToCamel
*
* Write a function that takes a string as an argument, converts it from snake case to camel
* case, and returns the new string.
*
* Your function should be able to handle underscores at the beginning or end
* of the string as well. If the underscore is the first character, it should capitalize the following letter. 
* If the underscore is the last character it should not be present on the resulting string.
*
* snake case: words_separated_by_underscores
* camel case: wordsSeparatedByCapitals
* snakeToCamel("hello_there_world");  -> "helloThereWorld"
* snakeToCamel("_hello_there_world_");  -> "HelloThereWorld"
*
* @param {String} str - The string to be camel cased
* @return {string} The resulting camel case string
