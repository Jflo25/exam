# Precourse Assessment

This will assess your learning of Javascript, HTML, and CSS from the precourse. There are no tests. It is up to you to determine if your answers are correct.

### Getting started

- [ ] Fork this repo and then clone your fork.
- [ ] Complete Part 1 and Part 2 below
- [ ] By the end of the allotted time, submit a pull request from your fork to the branch on Become a Software Engineer that is named after your GitHub username.
  - Do **not** submit a pull request to the `main` branch as it will not be graded properly.

### Part 1 - Javascript

Complete the four challenges in the `js` folder. To test your answers, you might want to test them out in the Chrome console or in the terminal with NodeJS. Unlike the precourse assignments, there are no tests provided for you to check your code on this assessment.

Be sure your functions handle common edge cases such as arrays and strings of length 0 being passed in as arguments!

Note: There is a custom eslint configuration for this assessment. If you did not globally install eslint during the precourse you can install it locally now. Simply navigate to your precourse-assessment directory in the terminal and run `npm install`.

### Part 2 - HTML/CSS

In the time available, create the closest possible clone of [this website](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). Do not use the Chrome DevTools to inspect the DOM. What will you use to achieve the two-column layout? Tables? Divs? Do this in `index.html` and `style.css`.

**BONUS:** Add a perpetually rotating picture of an animal to your page WITHOUT using CSS3 animations, i.e. via JavaScript.

### Submitting your work

At the end of the allotted time, `commit` and then push your work to your forked GitHub repo. Then, submit a pull request from your fork to the branch named after your GitHub username. Make sure you pull request into your branch name, **not** into the `main` branch. If you need help submitting a pull request, just post in the Slack help desk channel.
