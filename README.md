# Entrance Assessment

This will assess your learning of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

### Getting started

- [ ] Fork this repo and then clone your fork.
- [ ] Complete Part 1 and Part 2 below

### Part 1 - Javascript

Complete the four challenges in the `js` folder. To test your answers, you might want to test them out in the Chrome console or in the terminal with NodeJS. 

Be sure your functions handle common edge cases such as arrays and strings of length 0 being passed in as arguments!


### Part 2 - HTML/CSS

Create the closest possible clone of [this website](https://www.geico.com/). 

### Submitting your work

At the end of the allotted time, `commit` and then push your work to your forked GitHub repo. Then, submit a pull request from your fork to the branch named after your GitHub username. Make sure you pull request into your branch name, **not** into the `main` branch. If you need help submitting a pull request, just post in the Slack help desk channel.
